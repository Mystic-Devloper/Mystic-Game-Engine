## üåü About Mystic Game Engine
The **Mystic Game Engine** (MGE for short) is a modern, high-performance
engine designed for building games. Built from the ground up using **C++**
and the latest **Vulkan** graphics API, it leverages low-level access to 
hardware for maximum performance and efficiency. 

## üí° Features
* **Vulkan Graphics API**: Utilizes Vulkan for explicit control over rendering, 
multi-threaded command buffer generation, and cross-platform compatibility.

* **GLFW**: Utilizes GLFW for cross-compatible window management and user input
gathering.

* **Modern C++**: Written with C++20 standard for clean, efficient and maintainable
codebase.

* **Custom IO**: Utilizes a custom IO built for fast data input and output.

* **Custom Memory Management**: Utilizes custom memory management for fast memory and low
fragmentation.

* **Quality Audio**: Utilizes miniaudio for audio playback, supporting vast number of formats,
(including, mp3, flac, wav and, midi).

* **Image and Texture**: Utilizes custom Image backend built upon STB project for high quality
images and textures, with features like gamma correction, color correction and image compression.
With support for a vast number of formats (including, .png, .jpeg, .gif and, .svg).

* **Fast and Reliable Math**: Utilized GLM the de facto math library for any graphics program.

* **Model Support**: Supports a many major model formats (including, .obj, .fbx and, .gltf).

* **Modular Architecture**: The engine is designed with a modular approach,
allowing developers to easily swap out or integrate different systems
(e.g., physics, audio) without major refactoring.

* **Cross Platform**: Engineered to run on multiple platforms, (i.e., Windows, Linux and MacOS).

## ‚ú® The Why Behind The Project
This project is created by me, as a solo developer to push my knowledge of Graphics Software
to its limit. So, it can have some minor to major bugs.

## üöÄ Getting Started
To build and run the Mystic Game Engine, you will need the following prerequisites:
* **C++ Compiler**: A C++ Compiler that supports C++17/20 or later (e.g., GCC, MSVC, Clang).
* **CMake**: CMake Version 3.21 or higher.
* **GLFW Library**: Necessary for window management and user input.
* **Vulkan SDK**: Necessary for render pipeline and rendering logic.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Building from Source
1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mystic-devloper/Mystic-Game-Engine.git
cd Mystic-Game-Engine
```
2. Generate Project File with CMake
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G "[Your Build System]"
```

3. Build the Project
```bash
cmake --build build
```
After a successful build, you would see:
1. Some Games in build/bin
2. Game Engine's Library (libMGE.a for static and libMGE.so for dynamic)

## ü§ù Contributing
MGE is not a full fledged Game Engine, but still I welcome every contribution
from everyone, because it is the backbone of our open-source community.
